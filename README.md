# ASMR C DSA: Data Structures and Algorithms

A comprehensive repository for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented purely in **C**. This project contains efficient implementations of popular data structures and algorithms, designed for beginners and enthusiasts to learn and practice the art of problem-solving in C.

## 🚀 Features

### **Data Structures**

- **Linked List**: Singly Linked List.
- **Bool**: Boolean enum, and converting other data types to boolean.
- **Dict (dictionary)**: Inspired by Python's **dict** data type.
- **HashMap**: Dynamic Key-Value pairs with hashing.
- **String**: Dynamic String, like in Python.
- **Set**: Dynamic collection with unique values.
- **Queue**: FIFO (First In First Out).
- **Stack**: LIFO (Last In First Out).
- **Dynamic Array**: Dynamic array similar to **list** in Python and **vector** in C++.

### **Algorithms**

#### **Mathematical Algorithms**

- Prime Number.
- GCD and LCM.
- Fibonacci Sequence.
- Factorial.
- Mean, Sum, Max, Min.

#### **Searching Algorithms**

- Linear Search.
- Binary Search.

#### **Sorting Algorithms**

- Bubble Sort.
- Merge Sort.
- Quick Sort.
- Selection Sort.
- Insertion Sort.

## 📖 How to Use

### Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**: Make sure you have GCC or any other standard C compiler installed.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaverickPoly/asmr-c-dsa.git
cd asmr-c-dsa
```

### Compile and Run

Compile any file using GCC:

```bash
cd LinkedList && gcc tests.c linked_list.c -o main.exe && main.exe
```

## 🛠️ Future Plans

In the future, other complex data structures will be added, like _Trees_ and _Graphs_, along with algorithms, such as Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, and Prim's.
